## Packaging list ##

  1. Power supply, 12V-18V DC, >=20W. I think it's easier to find a PSU with a standard round DC connector, like [this one](http://domino2.kycon.com/catalog_PDF/KLDX_SMT2.pdf) and thus we need a converter cable to our Molex power connector.
  1. Converter cable from the Molex power connector to a standard round DC connector.
  1. U.FL-to-SMA-F pigtail cable.
  1. Two small antennas - omni or patch. One for Tx and one for Rx.
  1. Folding carton package.

## Not included ##

Below is a list of items which are non-essential and which we unlikely
to include in the package for this batch. We do no have them ready yet
and we don't want to delay shipping.  We focus our effort on polishing
UmTRX and UmSEL performance and software development which we see as a
more important tasks at this moment.

  1. Duplexer. Without a power amplifier UmTRXv2 is pretty low-power (50-100mW) and thus it works good enough without a duplexer in a normal environment. For our testing we use two small antennas - one for Rx and one for Tx without any issues.
  1. [Enclosure](UmTRXv2LabEnclosure.md). We'd love to have a nice table-top enclosure for UmTRX, but it requires a significant effort to source, design and assemble.
  1. UmSEL. It's not clear whether we will have UmSEL production setup in time. Software to control UmSEL is yet to be developed as well. Since it's only an improvement frontend, I don't think we should include it into the basic package.
